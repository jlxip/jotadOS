This driver is a piece of shit.
I couldn't make a working ATAPI driver, so I'm just using
BIOS interrupts (yeah, I know...).

I stopped working on the project for a while because I got
stuck on this, so the only chance that I keep developing it
is if I fall down to a shit driver.

Anyways, it's hardly ever going to be used, only at install,
so it isn't that big of a deal.

I might make this good in the future, but probably not.
So if you're reading this and you know how to code an ATAPI
driver, I would definitely merge a pull request upstream.
(In which case, please, flood it with comments.)
